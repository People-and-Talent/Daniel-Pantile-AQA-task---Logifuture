1. You guys did not provide any links/environments/pages etc .... so I searched for some similar sites that would act as the staging and non-staging enviroments. 
It was not that clear the re-direct process... I could not really find one site with re-direct..... non-theless ... I opted for maintaing the essence of the exercise ... beeing that it would use two separate environemtns with different locators etc and to handle transaitions between the two of them.
Instead of doing one/or/the other exercise I combined the two as :
    - The same login tests should work for two totally different sites (staging and non-staging) using the same code-base(method) to run tests
    - I would have switched to env. files but did not have the time to, nor did I need to in this exercise
    - I would use data providers ... json fixtures ... did not need to 
    - Of course there were more tests cases for login (invalid maiL+ valid pass, missing mail+  valid pass, valid emai + missing password) .... etc, I did not consider that it was relevant for the scope of this exercise since I made exercise1 and exercise2 to work as one .
